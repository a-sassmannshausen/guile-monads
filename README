* Guile Monads

  Guile Monads is a library providing a framework for using monads in Guile.
  It was created by extracting the monad modules used in GNU Guix, written by
  Ludovic Court√®s.  The primary aim is to make that implementation of monads
  available as a light-weight Guile module.

  Additionally, Guile Monads currently provides an "io monad", which
  facilitates purely functional input/output related programming.  Guile
  itself of course allows direct use of input/output, and normally it is left
  to the programmer interested in the functional style to use it responsibly.
  The io monad provides a model through which the programmer can more clearly
  think about how to maintain a referentially transparent program when using
  input/output.
